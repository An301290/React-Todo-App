# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React-Router-Dom

To be able to change from home page, todo-list and sign-up.

# useForm in React 

In the project I have used useForm hook in order to be able to manage the sign-up form.

# useRef

Within the todo-list in order to give me the same object on every render.

# Import React Icons

Implemented in the sign-up form
